Example: Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning
One common method involves using machine learning to predict whether a person has Parkinson's based on features like voice recordings, sensor data, or medical records. Here's an example using Python and machine learning libraries to classify whether someone has Parkinson’s or not, based on a dataset of features (like tremor frequency, speech characteristics, etc.)
Explanation:
Dataset: You would need a dataset that includes measurements from people with and without Parkinson's disease. You can find datasets online like the Parkinson's Disease Classification Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Features: In this case, the dataset contains various features that are typically measured in people with Parkinson's, such as characteristics of their voice, tremor frequencies, or movement patterns.
Model: A RandomForestClassifier is used to predict whether a person has Parkinson’s or not based on the input features.
Evaluation: The model’s performance is evaluated using accuracy, which compares the predicted results against the true values.
